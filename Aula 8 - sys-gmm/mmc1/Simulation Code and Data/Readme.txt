This study applies the software of StataMP 16.0 to conduct the econometric regression. 

Figs. 1 and 3 are drawn in the software of ArcGIS10.7, Figs. 2 and 4 are drawn in the software of OriginPro 9.1,  and Fig. 5 is drawn in the software of Visio.

Tables 3-9 are calculated by the software of StataMP 16.0, and the code is shown in "code.do".

The file of "log.smcl" can be opened by the software of StataMP 16.0, which shows the running process and results of the code file. 
If using a version lower than StataMP 16.0, you need to use the "type lob.smcl" code to open it.
